I love to learn and explore new technologies and am passionate about problem-solving. I love almost all the stacks of web application development and love to make the web more open to the world. My core skill is based on NextJs and I love to do most of the things using NextJs. I am available for any kind of job opportunity that suits my skills and interests. I am also good in DSA which can be seen in my GeeksforGeeks profile (5th Institute Rank). Apart from proagramming, I love to do workout, play guitar and listen to music`,
